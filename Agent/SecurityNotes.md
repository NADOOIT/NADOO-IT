# NADOO-IT Security Analysis

## Security Audit Summary (Manual Focus)

This summary highlights key areas requiring manual review and attention as part of a comprehensive security audit, especially since automated scans were skipped.

### 1. Authentication & Authorization
- **Custom User Model:** Review `nadooit_auth.models.User` for secure handling of `user_code` (generation, editability, uniqueness enforcement) and password storage (ensure proper hashing).
- **Custom Auth Backend:** Examine `custom_user_code_auth_backend.py` for robustness against timing attacks, enumeration, and lack of rate limiting.
- **API Key System:** Audit `nadooit_api_key.models.NadooitApiKey` for secure key generation (initial value is just `uuid.uuid4`), hashing implementation, rotation/expiration policies, and the implications of editable keys.
- **MFA Implementation:** Review the `django-mfa2` integration (custom fork) and settings (`MFA_RECHECK`, `MFA_QUICKLOGIN`) for secure configuration and potential bypasses.
- **Permissions:** Analyze the usage of `PermissionsMixin` and the `NadooitApiKeyManager` roles for potential privilege escalation issues and adherence to the principle of least privilege.

### 2. Input Validation & Sanitization
- **Across Modules:** Manually review code in all modules (especially those handling user input like `nadooit_crm`, `nadooit_hr`, `nadooit_website`, `nadooit_questions_and_answers`) for vulnerabilities like:
    - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
    - SQL Injection (especially if raw SQL is used anywhere)
    - Command Injection (if interacting with `nadooit_os`)
    - Insecure Deserialization
- **Django Forms & DRF Serializers:** Verify that forms and serializers implement strict validation.

### 3. Dependency Security
- **Manual Review:** Since `Safety` scan was skipped, manually review critical dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` against known vulnerability databases (e.g., CVE Details, Snyk Vulnerability DB).
- **Custom Forks:** Pay special attention to custom forks (`django-mfa2`, `django-pwa`) as they won't receive standard security updates.

### 4. Configuration Security
- **Environment Variables:** Ensure no sensitive data (`SECRET_KEY`, database credentials, API keys) is hardcoded. Verify secure handling of `.env` files.
- **`settings.py`:** Audit security-related settings like `DEBUG` (must be `False` in production), `ALLOWED_HOSTS`, `CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE`, `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE`, `SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT`.
- **Third-Party App Config:** Review configurations for apps like `grappelli`, `mfa`, `rest_framework` for security best practices.

### 5. Sensitive Data Handling
- **Modules:** Investigate modules like `nadooit_crm`, `nadooit_hr`, `nadooit_workflow`, `nadooit_time_account` for secure storage (encryption at rest?), transmission (HTTPS enforced?), and access control of sensitive user/customer data.
    - **PII in `nadooit_crm.Customer`**: The `Customer` model contains PII. Ensure queries and displays are sanitized, and access is logged and restricted.

- **`nadoo_complaint_management.Complaint`**: The `complaint` text field can contain sensitive operational details or PII related to a customer's program execution. Access to view/manage complaints should be strictly controlled and logged.

- **`nadooit_delivery.Order` & `OrderItem`**: These models will store customer order history, which is PII. Ensure appropriate access controls and consider data retention policies once the module is functional.

- **`nadooit_key.KeyManager`**: This model defines a critical permissions layer for managing unspecified "keys".
    - Review how an `Employee` is initially designated as a `KeyManager`.
    - Ensure robust access controls on creating/modifying `KeyManager` instances, especially the `can_..._key_managers` fields.
    - Recommend an audit trail for all changes to `KeyManager` instances and their permissions.
    - The actual enforcement of these boolean permissions in the key management views/APIs (likely in `nadooit_api_key` or other modules) needs to be verified.

- **`nadooit_network` Module:**
    - Review privacy implications of friends lists, group, and guild memberships. Implement appropriate visibility settings if necessary (e.g., public, friends-only, private).
    - The `NadooitInventory` system (money, program shares) needs robust transactional integrity and security to prevent unauthorized modification, duplication, or exploits. Consider using database-level transaction control (e.g., `django.db.transaction.atomic`) and `select_for_update` for operations modifying balances.
    - Access to modify group/guild memberships and roles (e.g., promoting a `NadooitNetworkGuildMember` to MODERATOR or ADMIN) must be strictly controlled and logged.

- **`nadooit_os` Module (Central Admin Hub):**
    - This module is highly security-critical as it acts as a central administrative hub with extensive permissions checks based on `nadooit_hr` contract models and other role definitions (e.g., `NadooitApiKeyManager` via `user.employee.nadooitapikeymanager`).
    - **Action:** Thoroughly audit all role-checking functions in `views.py` (e.g., `user_is_Time_Account_Manager`, `user_is_Api_Key_Manager`, etc.) and the views/services that grant roles (e.g., `give_..._role` views) to ensure they correctly and securely implement the principle of least privilege and prevent privilege escalation.
    - **Action:** Pay close attention to views that modify data across modules (e.g., creating/revoking API keys, (de)activating contracts, sending complaints). Ensure these have robust authorization checks, considering all edge cases.
    - **Action:** Review the business logic within the numerous functions in `nadooit_os.services.py` as these are called by the views and perform critical operations.
    - **Consideration:** Implement rate limiting or other abuse prevention mechanisms for sensitive actions within `nadooit_os` views if not already present (e.g., for API key creation, role granting).

- **`nadooit_questions_and_answers` Module:**
    - The `submit_question` view (`your_question_we_answer/question/<str:session_id>/`) uses `@csrf_exempt`. 
        - **Action:** Evaluate the necessity of `@csrf_exempt`. If the endpoint is called from front-end JavaScript within the same domain, standard CSRF protection should be used. If it's an API for external clients, consider stateless authentication (e.g., API keys, JWT) instead of relying solely on `session_id` for authorization and forgoing CSRF. The current `session_id` check via `nadooit_website.services.check__session_id__is_valid` validates the session's existence but not necessarily if the *request itself* is legitimately initiated by the user associated with that session for this specific action.
    - Input validation for the `question` in the JSON payload should be robust to prevent potential injection or oversized data issues, though Django's model TextFields offer some protection against SQL injection.

- **`nadooit_website` Module (Core Website & Personalization):**
    - **File Uploads:**
        - **Action:** Review file upload handling mechanisms in `Video`, `VideoResolution`, and `File` models. Ensure robust validation of file types, sizes, and content to prevent attacks (e.g., uploading malicious executables disguised as images/videos, denial-of-service via overly large files).
        - **Action:** The direct filesystem manipulation (`os.rename`, `os.remove`) in `Video.save()` and `VideoResolution.save()` is a security risk. If paths are not strictly controlled and validated, it could lead to path traversal vulnerabilities allowing an attacker to read/write/delete arbitrary files on the server. Refactor to use Django's storage API.
    - **HTML Content Injection (XSS):**
        - **Action:** `Section.html` and `Plugin.html` store HTML content. If this content can be input or influenced by users (even privileged ones via admin), ensure that it is properly sanitized before rendering to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. Use Django's built-in template escaping or libraries like `django-bleach` if user-generated HTML is allowed.
    - **CSRF:** Standard CSRF protection should be applied to all views that modify data, unless explicitly and safely handled otherwise (e.g., for stateless APIs with token authentication).
    - **Session Management:** Ensure `session_id` generation is cryptographically secure and that session data stored in `Session` model doesn't leak sensitive information if somehow exposed.
    - **A/B Testing Logic:** While not a direct vulnerability, flawed logic in A/B testing or personalization (e.g., in `ExperimentGroup`, `Section_Order`) could lead to information disclosure if users are incorrectly bucketed or see content not intended for them.

## Authentication & Authorization (`nadooit_auth`)
- **Debug Mode:** Confirm `DEBUG = False` in production to prevent detailed error pages.
- **Exception Handling:** Review `try...except` blocks to ensure they don't leak sensitive system information.

### 7. Access Control & Session Management
- **Session Security:** Verify secure session cookie settings (`SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE`, `SESSION_COOKIE_HTTPONLY`).
- **CSRF Protection:** Ensure Django's CSRF protection is enabled and correctly implemented, especially with HTMX interactions.
- [ ] **`bot_management` Module:**
  - [ ] Correct typo in subdirectory name: `plattforms` should likely be `platforms` (affects directory structure and potentially import paths).

- [ ] **`nadooit_delivery` Module:**
  - [ ] **Critical Model Error:** `OrderItem.product` field is a `ForeignKey` to an undefined `Product` model. This prevents migrations and module functionality. Investigate if it should reference `nadoo_erp.models.Item` or if `Product` needs to be defined/imported. Correct and create initial migration.

- [ ] **`nadooit_key` Module:**
  - [ ] Correct typo in `KeyManager.key_managers_assigened_by_this_key_manager` to `key_managers_assigned_by_this_key_manager`. (Requires model change and new migration).

- [ ] **`nadooit_network` Module:**
  - [ ] Fix `AttributeError` bugs in `NadooitNetworkFriendslist.__str__` (should access `self.friend_list.all()` or similar for iteration/display) and `NadooitNetworkGuildMember.__str__` (no `guild_member` attribute; likely meant to use `self.nadooit_network_member.user.display_name` and `self.get_guild_role_display()`).
  - [ ] For `NadooitNetworkGroup.members`:
    - Implement validation in the model's `save()` method or a form to enforce the commented 10-member limit, if strict.
    - Enforce an uneven number of members (e.g., 1, 3, 5, 7, 9) if group voting mechanisms are planned, to prevent stalemates. Consider how this interacts with the max limit.
  - [ ] Clarify the design of `NadooitGuildBank`. If it's only a collective guild inventory, update the comment. If per-user contributions are intended, this model needs redesign (e.g., a `GuildTransaction` model or a `ManyToManyField` with a `through` table storing user contributions).

## General Codebase Health & Security
- **DRF Settings:** Review Django REST Framework settings for appropriate authentication, permissions, and throttling.
- **`nadooit_api_key`:** Re-iterate the need to audit API key security (generation, storage, rotation).

## API Key Security Analysis

### API Key Model Characteristics
- UUID-based primary key
- Unique API key for each user
- Hashing mechanism for API key storage

### API Key Security Observations
- Positive aspects:
  1. API keys are hashed before storage
  2. Unique constraint on API keys
  3. Tracking of API key creation and updates

### Potential API Key Vulnerabilities
- Editable API keys could be a security risk
- No explicit key rotation mechanism
- Lack of comprehensive access control

### API Key Management Recommendations
- Implement strict API key rotation policy
  - Automatic key expiration
  - Forced periodic key regeneration
- Add comprehensive logging for API key usage
- Create detailed audit trails

### API Key Role Management
- `NadooitApiKeyManager` provides granular role-based controls
- Potential improvements:
  - More detailed permission granularity
  - Implement time-limited role assignments
  - Add approval workflow for role changes

### Recommended API Key Security Enhancements
- Implement rate limiting for API requests
- Add IP and geolocation-based API key restrictions
- Create comprehensive API key usage monitoring
- Develop anomaly detection for API key usage patterns

### API Key Lifecycle Management
- Implement secure key generation process
- Create key revocation mechanisms
- Add notifications for key-related activities
- Develop self-service key management portal

### API Key Handling (`nadooit_api_key` & `bot_management`)
- **Storage & Generation:**
    - `NadooitApiKey.api_key` and `bot_management.BotPlatform.access_token` store sensitive credentials.
    - **Concern:** Review how these keys/tokens are stored (encryption at rest?), generated, and if they are ever exposed in logs or API responses. The `NadooitApiKey.api_key` being `editable=True` and `default=uuid.uuid4` (which is not a cryptographically secure token) is a concern.
    - **Recommendation:** Ensure tokens are generated using cryptographically secure methods (e.g., `secrets.token_hex`), are hashed or encrypted at rest (e.g., using Django's `Fernet`), and that raw tokens are not logged. Implement secure practices for token display (e.g., only show on creation) and management (revocation, rotation).
    - For `bot_management.BotPlatform.access_token`, understand its lifecycle: how is it obtained, stored, and used? Is it a third-party token?
    - `bot_management.APIKey` stores a `uuid4` as the key, which is good, but ensure this isn't confused with less secure key generation elsewhere.
- **Permissions & Scope:** Review the permissions and scope of `bot_management` API keys to ensure they are not overly permissive.

### Compliance and Governance
- Ensure API key practices align with security standards
- Create documentation for API key usage
- Implement regular security reviews
- Develop incident response plan for API key compromises
