Important section from LinkedIN Documentation:

2.3 Test Profiles

You may create LinkedIn test profiles to test your Application, provided that they do not interact with real Members or company or other organization pages on LinkedIn.
You may create up to five test LinkedIn Member profiles for purposes of testing your Application only. You must create the profiles manually and not via automated means, such as scripts.

Test profiles must: (a) generally appear to be standard LinkedIn Member profiles; (b) not interact with non-test profiles (for example, you may only share Content with other test profiles, you cannot use test profiles to comment on posts, and you cannot connect test profiles with non-test profiles, such as your own personal LinkedIn profile); (c) not use a stock photo or any photo that is not your own; and (d) not override our API call limits.  You must clearly identify the profiles as test profiles using your company’s name (if applicable) in the headline “Test Profile at [insert real company name]”. You may not: (1) use a test profile to manage your Application; (2) create any profile positions at real companies (besides your own) for the test profiles; or (3) create any test companies.

NOT ALLOWED:

Use any Content in any advertisements or for purposes of targeting advertisements specifically to any individual User (whether such advertisements appear in the Application or elsewhere), or to generate mass messages, promotions or offers;
